# Contributing Guidelines

If you are considering contributing please read through this document, if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask in the [CodeSupport Discord](https://discord.gg/Hn9SETt).

Contributions to the Discord Bot **must** pass our ESLint check and be approved by at least one person before being merged.

## Contributing Steps
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch using the format `feature/<short-summary>`
    - For example, if you were adding a hello world command: `feature/add-hello-world-command`
3. Pull in develop, do not base your changes off of any other branch
4. Make any changes you wish
5. Create a pull request, merging your branch back into the CodeSupport Discord Bot repository's develop branch

## Pull Requests
- Make small feature based pull requests, this makes it easier to read
- The title of your pull request should give a good summary of the change
- The description of your pull request should detail what has changed, along with any information people should be aware of
- Please include your Discord username (if it is not the same as your GitHub username) so we know who you are

_**Please note:** contributing does not guarantee the Contributor role in CodeSupport: it will entirely depend on what you contribute._
